## Crowd-Sourced Driven Dictionary
Technicians can suggest new words, and even fill some, if not all, data needed to fill the word's page.
By using a simple-to-use bottomsheet component, they can fill the "suggest a word" form swiftly.

All suggested words are uploaded to a separate list in the database, waiting for admin approval.
After approval, the word makes it's way to the master-list of words, ready to be queried and shown.
