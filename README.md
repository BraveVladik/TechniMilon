### Technical English - Hebrew Crowd-Sourced Dictionary
Android application developed for the technicians of the IAF.
With this app, technicians can quickly look up for any technical term specified in technical data sheets.

Each word in the dictionary consists:
* Translation to English / Hebrew
* Text-To-Speech button
* Image
* Example sentences - both in English / Hebrew
* Synonyms

**Note:** Not all words contain every type of data.

## Crowd-Sourced Driven Dictionary
Technicians can suggest new words, and even fill some, if not all, data needed to fill the word's page.
By using a simple-to-use bottomsheet component, they can fill the "suggest a word" form swiftly.

All suggested words are uploaded to a separate list in the database, waiting for admin approval.
After approval, the word makes it's way to the master-list of words, ready to be queried and shown.
